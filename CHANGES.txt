Changelog of lizard-sticky
===================================================


1.9 (unreleased)
----------------

- Changed views to classes to work with latest lizard-map. Updated
  templates to reflect this.

- Changed setup.py to require at least the currently latest 
  lizard-map (3.4.2) and lizard-ui (3.7).

- Added dependency of map >= 1.60.


1.8 (2011-04-21)
----------------

- Removed unnecessary workspace_manager and date_range_form stuff. It
  is also incompatible with map >= 1.71.

1.7 (2011-03-01)
----------------

1.6 (2011-02-28)
----------------

  now saved in original projection (i.e. google, rd). When drawing
  layer, tell mapnik the projection setting in MAP_SETTINGS. This also
  fixes a problem when the client is not in 900913
